# Git_Hub_Basics
The Basica according to Me (Windows Version)
This is not meant to be all inclusive, there's always more than one way to skin a cat.
Anything I dont explain to your satisfation is googleable i promise! better yet if you know how to access chat-GPT, ask your questions there and your answers will be thorught specific and interactive (lots of copy and paste)

GitHub is where everything is free but nothing is easy

README files are the source of all the answers to your problems

Things to have and need to know
Command prompt or Conda is where all of your greatest successes and frustrations will occur

There are tons of programming languanges, just start with Python
Python -  https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.4/python-3.11.4-amd64.exe

Pip is python's right hand man.  Pip installs all
PIP - https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
copy get-pip.py to same folder (directory) as python 
If you dont know where python installed itself, just search for python and find the folder named Python x.xx
Open Command prompt, change directory (cd) to python folder (right-click folder, copy path as text) paste after cd, hit enter.
type python get-pip.py, hit enter
Now you can install stuff

Directories, locations and environment variables are critical
Fuck these up and you will waste so much of your time
Make sure you install pip in the same directory as python

In Command Prompt:
python.exe -m pip show pip, hit enter
python --version, hit enter
to make sure both are installed

Next needs:
Anaconda/Conda/MiniConda - 
VSCode 

Try to keep all projects or groups of projects in seperate virtual environments.  Dependencies are a bitch.

Conda create -name [user-selected-venv-name]

After created - conda activate [user-selected-venv-name]

execute all command line prompts through conda with a venv activated
write, debug and test all code with VSCode.  It plays well with others and is fairly robust.

Now the fun stuff, installing repositories.
I mean that seriously and sarcastically.  I still mess shit up, but the idea is

got to repository page
clikc green button and go to
